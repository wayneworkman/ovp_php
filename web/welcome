Welcome to Perpetuum! This is a quick overview of the site. 

First, what this site is not:

This site is not a direct replacement for YouTube. There is no comment system,
No likes or dislikes, no subscribers, no searching.

The concept:

Upload here, then share your videos on other platforms such as Patreon, Twitter,
Facebook, or other platforms. There's several ways to share. Regular URLs,
A variety of embed code, or a QR-code image that links directly to your video.

What we like:

Free speach, free expression of thought, and other fun stuff.

What we don't like:

Illegal stuff, copyright infringed material.

When would we take down your videos?

If we get a takedown notice stating that the content is beyond fair-use of 
copyrighted material (infringed copyright) and the claim seems valid. 
If we get a court order to take down a video. We will not take down
videos just because they are unpopular or taboo.

Are your videos private?

Your videos are not private to site administrators. Beyond this,
anyone with the link can view the video.


Concepts to work with:

The link for your video normally will not change, even if you delete and
re-upload. The link is made from a cryptographic checksum that is unique
to your video file. To get a different link, use a different file.

Videos uploaded in mp4 format do not get re-converted, so this is faster.
However, you can upload in whatever format you like, and it'll get convered
to mp4.

Only hits on the public links to your videos are counted as views.



That's about it, have fun sharing content!
