<br>
Welcome to Perpetuum! This is a quick overview of the site.<br>
<br>
First, what this site is not:<br>
<br>
This site is not a direct replacement for YouTube, but aims to compete<br>
with YouTube. There isn't a comment system, No likes or dislikes,<br>
no subscribers, no searching.<br>
<br>
The concept:<br>
<br>
Upload here, then share your videos on other platforms such as Patreon, Twitter,<br>
Facebook, or other platforms. There are several ways to share. Regular URLs,<br>
A variety of embed code, or a QR-code image that links directly to your video.<br>
<br>
What we like:<br>
<br>
Free speech, free expression of thought, and other fun stuff.<br>
<br>
What we don't like:<br>
<br>
Illegal stuff, copyright infringed material.<br>
<br>
When would we take down your videos?<br>
<br>
If we get a takedown notice stating that the content is beyond fair-use of<br>
copyrighted material (infringed copyright) and the claim is verified as valid.<br>
If we get a court order to take down a video. We will not take down<br>
videos just because they are unpopular or taboo.<br>
<br>
Are your videos private?<br>
<br>
Your videos are not private to site administrators. Beyond this,<br>
anyone with the link can view the video.<br>
<br>
<br>
Concepts to work with:<br>
<br>
People have to know the link to see the video. The link for your video<br>
normally will not change, even if you delete and re-upload. The link is<br>
made from a cryptographic checksum that is unique to your video file.<br>
To get a different link, use a different file.<br>
<br>
Videos uploaded in mp4 format do not get re-converted, so this is faster.<br>
However, you can upload in whatever format you like, and it'll get convered<br>
to mp4.<br>
<br>
Only hits on the public links to your videos are counted as views.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That's about it, have fun sharing content!<br>
